# YOU-make-the-repo

EVERYONE gets to make the repo one bit (or byte, or kilobyte, or megabyte, or gigabyte, or terabyte) at a time, using forks and Pull Requests. this is by far the strangest project "i" have made. <br>

Add anything, whether it's images, markdown files, HTML documents, or even assembly code, you can add it! <br>
Fork this repo to add your own changes, and then give me a pull request!
